# Better Ark Server Manager

Cross-platform (Windows & Linux) Electron-based manager for Ark: Survival Evolved dedicated servers.

- One-click SteamCMD setup and server install/update
- Branch selection (stable/beta)
- Start/Stop/Restart with live status and logs
- Mods: add/remove/reorder and auto-update; mod search by name (Steam Workshop)
- Full settings UI exposing essentially all Ark server options (no manual INI editing required)
- Advanced raw editors for GameUserSettings.ini and Game.ini (optional)

See the project plan in docs/PLANNING.md for details and milestones.
